# JayPortfolioWebsite

My first responsive portfolio


<div>
<p>Update 5/11/2023</p>
<p>Added JavaScript validation to contact form and fixed bug where email was not properly being sent</p>
</div> 
<P>Problem is still on going using smtp.js library to receive email.</p>
<p>Temporary fix: using Formspree as an alternative</p>
<br>
<div>
<p>**what's coming next: Edit project section, so that user can see the information without having to hover over each card.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div>
My next goal: Developing portfolio website with react.
