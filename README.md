# JayPortfolioWebsite

My first responsive portfolio website built with HTML CSS JavaScript.

<div>
Update 5/11/2023
<br/>
Added JavaScript validation to contact form and fixed bug where email was not properly being sent
<br/>
**what's coming next: Edit project section, so that user can see the information without having to hover over each card.
</div>

My next goal: develop portfolio website with react.
